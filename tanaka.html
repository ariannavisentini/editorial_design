  <p>Tatsuya Tanaka, the world's first "miniature" photographer, is drawing attention from all over the globe. He keeps on shooting one photograph a day for more than nine years.
    Mr. Tanaka was born in 1981 in Kumamoto, graduated from university as an art major, and became the art director at a design firm. Making plastic models and collecting miniature figures were his hobbies, which led to him posting photographs of miniatures on Instagram. His works became very popular, so he turned into a "miniature" photographer, and founded Miniature Life.
